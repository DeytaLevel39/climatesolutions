Wordpress is still very much the easiest way of starting up your own website, but this article is describing a method of generating a static website for a relatively technical audience who want full control. Static vs Dynamic Static site's content is fixed from when you generate the content, whereas dynamic website's can update the content, typically by retrieval from a backend database Pelican Over the past few days, I've been prompted to create my own static site. 2 drivers led to his.:- A friend of mine wanted full control over a blogging website having previously used Facebook blog and lost the content. I already have a dynamic web site http://www.deytalytics.com written in Python/Flask, which has whitepaper/blog post/article content in it. I've found it a pain to add content to it, as I handcrafted it in Python/Flask so every article requires me to cut and paste html. It also doesn't have neat features such as tags & categorisation which is kind of expected nowadays and would improve the ability of search engines to process and deliver the content to a wider audience. As my current website is already written in Python, I looked for a static site generator that was written in that language. I came across https://blog.getpelican.com/ What are the advantages of Pelican? Pelican provides the following Content Management System (CMS) capabilities:- Splits the production of content (which can be created in markdown or HTML), from CMS IT. Automatically groups blog posts by tags & categories identified by the author Allows sharing of content to social media e.g. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp Adds comment functionality to articles/blog posts by using 3rd party comment engines e.g. Disqus A common theme is applied consistently across the static website and the pelican community have provided almost 200 base themes at http://www.pelicanthemes.com Can be hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Github pages. This has 2 key advantages. Firstly it's free/very low cost. Secondly, they tend to be more performant than the free tiers offered by the major cloud providers Can allow a Site to be searched for content Additional functionality can be provided via plugins. See https://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/plugins.html Posts/Articles are automatically sorted by date As metadata has to be included with the content, this makes it easier for search engines to understand what you publish When shouldn't you use Pelican? If you don't mind a 3rd party owning and controlling your content, the online blogging sites are much easier to get set up Pelican is really geared up for content publication e.g. blogging. It's not suitable for ecommerce or any dynamic content (content that changes dependent on what the user has chosen). Work in Progress I'm currently at the stage where I've implemented capabilities 1, 2, 3, 5 & 6 and the result can be viewed at https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/ . The theme is similar to my existing website http://www.deytalytics.com Next Steps Add in the missing capabilities 4 & 7 Add articles from my existing website and linkedin posts Integrate the static site in with my existing dynamic website as an additional menu option","tags":"Solution Architecture","url":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/pelican-website-info.html","loc":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/pelican-website-info.html"},{"title":"Fintech Alexa Skills Demo","text":"","tags":"Solution Architecture","url":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/alexa-skills-video.html","loc":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/alexa-skills-video.html"},{"title":"Creating a business glossary","text":"Article first published at www.deytalytics.com Why do you need a business glossary? Most companies tend to buy systems that meet particular needs of a particular business function e.g. sales, marketing, hr, finance etc. Users of these systems then start to learn the terminology which is peculiar to that particular system. Problems arise when there is a need to report on data stored across multiple systems. In this situation, there may be many systems from which you wish to pull information from, each of which have their own dialect. Identifiable business benefits of creating a business glossary include:- Clear reporting – field labels in reports are typically abbreviated and often the same term can lead to a multitude of labels. By linking a field label to a business glossary term, it becomes clear what the report is telling you. A clear understanding of each other's terminology allows different functional areas to work together more effectively – it reduces the ‘Tower of Babel' problem. It helps to identify subject matter experts within the business – the authors of the terms are likely to be those with the best knowledge as to how systems and reports work. It allows information about business rules e.g. conditional logic, KPIs and format enforcement to maintained centrally rather than hidden within systems Gets rid of system-specific terminology which becomes problematic when the organisation needs to change systems. Is a business glossary simply a dictionary? A business glossary is more like a thesaurus than a dictionary. A dictionary provides multiple meanings for the same sounding word e.g. volume may refer to loudness of sound or it may refer to capacity of a liquid or space, whereas a thesaurus provides multiple words with the same meaning e.g. volume, bulk, cubic measure are different terms used for a capacity of a liquid or space. Who should create a business glossary? Bear in mind that people don't work in isolation but fit in to a particular community with a language developing that serves a particular purpose. With that thought, you need to identify those communities within your organisation. Typically, they'll cluster around specific business functional areas e.g. marketing, sales, hr, finance and different geographies. Within this community, there will be people who already face the task of needing to understand terms across multiple systems e.g. management reporting faces this task. So these will be your natural author community. What features should your business glossary have? The following features will lend themselves to providing a glossary which is practically useful to your organisation:- Cost effective – It's really important that the cost of the business glossary doesn't outweigh the benefits that you expect to get from it. Usable – If you want subject matter experts to compile a business glossary for your organisation, then you've got to choose a product that they want to actually use. It shouldn't feel like a chore to add information to the glossary User & Group roles – you want to allow as many people as possible to add candidate terms & definitions to the glossary, but you still need the concept of an editor to approve those terms for approval, to ensure quality. Multiple users – many users need to be able to search for, add and approve content of the glossary Auditing – you'll need to ensure that any changes to content are audited, since you'll have links to your business glossary from systems and reports, so you don't want the content to be changed in an adverse way without knowing who did it. Workflow mechanism – you'll need an approval process for the content Terms & definitions – Need to be able to create terms and definitions to produce rich content Related terms – need to be able to relate terms produced by different functional areas to each other, so that the aim of improving understanding can be achieved Classification schemes – This covers 2 areas – you need to be able to group your terms in to structures so that you can drill up and down the structure in a logical way. It's also useful for the business glossary to hold information about how to classify data in your systems. For example, the Dewey Decimal Classification system is a well known way of labeling books, so that a book can be easily found in a library. Code sets (list of values, enumerations) – The business glossary can hold pre-defined lists for certain data items. e.g. ISO provide lists of countries & currencies. by using pre-defined code sets, it makes it easier to integrate your data with other system's data both externally & internally. Import/export metadata – although having an online searchable business glossary is a great step forward for a business, there is typically a need to export the content so that it can be processed elsewhere and to import content from industry standard material or glossaries provided by systems or previously produced within the organisation. Search engine – It's often difficult to know exactly the term that you're searching for, so having a Google style search capability, makes it easier to discover relevant content. Business rules – Conditional logic, Key performance indicators/measures and validation rules e.g. email should be of format @ are important for ensuring that data is standardised and consistent which improves data quality and integration Supportable – The IT team will need to be able to back up the glossary and support the system without extensive additional training being required. Hyperlink from a reporting tool/system – A key benefit is to be able to provide hyperlinks from system or report fields to terms within the business glossary. This eliminates the ambiguity of meaning that typically uncontrolled abbreviated field labeling can cause. Other features that you might wish to consider include:- Linking to fields in your data modeling tool. It can be useful to link data elements in your data model to business terms when those data elements will be made visible to business users. Linking to validation rules from a data quality/master data management tool – this means that you don't need to replicate validation rules with data quality systems, that have been defined in your business glossary already Available in the cloud – The business glossary needs to be shareable by multiple users. Having it on a network drive achieves that, but by putting it on a public or private cloud, the business glossary will be available from multiple media and from home and work, providing the ability to research terms at will. Where can I get a business glossary? As with reporting, Microsoft Excel remains the most popular choice for business glossaries, simply because it's free and everybody has it on their desktop. Bear in mind, however, that such an approach would meet few of the features listed above, without extensive development required. Cost is more than just the initial purchase costs, it also includes the development and support (including maintenance & training) costs. When business glossary terms exceed about 100 terms, the effort required to relate terms via hyperlinks becomes tiresome, and you need to start to think about using more professional tools, as it will save you time. Business Glossary tools which have more of the necessary features (thereby reducing development costs) include:- Collibra Business Systems Glossary Adaptive Business Glossary Manager Kalido Business Information Modeler Infosphere Business Glossary Informatica Metadata Manager & Business Glossary","tags":"Solution Architecture","url":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/business-glossary.html","loc":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/business-glossary.html"},{"title":"Selecting digital platform technologies","text":"What is a digital platform It's a generic term for a capability which covers aspects of building a website or an app. It includes features such as:- Customer Identification & access management (CIAM) This capability includes Identification/authentication of a customer and capture of profile information from social media (if customer chooses to register via a social media authentication provider e.g. facebook, linkedin). Access management allows the customer to access only that content that they're entitled to. For example, web pages behind a paywall or digital assets such as ebooks. Web Content Creation/Management System The web content creation capability allows you to construct web pages for your site and to integrate functionality on the web page with back end systems e.g. an Ad server. The web content management aspect allows digital assets e.g. images, videos, ebooks to be uniquely identified and stored in a searchable data store. Shopping Cart Designed to allow saleable products (stored in the product price book) to be added to a web-based shopping basket and the sales statement calculated prior to a call being made to the payments engine for the customer to complete the sale. Web Analytics Provides statistics about digital events carried out by a user of a website e.g. customer clicks on a button, hyperlink or advertisement. Content Personalisation Delivers content to a user based on their profile e.g. their location, their language, interests. Is this the same as ecommerce? No. Ecommerce is the term for functionality which allows a consumer to purchase products online via a shopping cart functionality with payments processed via a back end payments engine. A digital platform could simply be used for marketing or to provide free products without requiring payment. Ecommerce is the shopping cart element of the digital platform in combination with a payments engine.. Is a digital platform suitable for all sales models? No. A digital platform can be used as a sales channel suitable for selling low value one off or subscription products. Products that are high value either individually or in bulk, and services are types of sales that still benefit from an offline personal approach. What are the popular digital platform technologies? Currently, there isn't a one stop shop for building out all aspects of a digital platform. Web Content Creation & Management System For creating web content and storing content in a content/digital asset management system, Gartner's magic quadrant looks like this:- Adobe & Sitecore are the 2 leading web development/content management systems used by large companies. Of the two, Adobe Experience Manager is, in my opinion, the stronger option as Adobe Analytics is also strong in the web analytics space and the less vendors you have to deal with the better. For individuals, wordpress.com (hosted website - not shown) is a very popular choice, and for micro and small businesses wordpress.org (allows you to host your own website). Setting up a wordpress site on AWS provides details as to how to set your site up yourself on the Amazon cloud. Drupal is also a well established contender in this area for companies that need more control over integration and are happy for IT to be more involved in the website development. eCommerce Since Demandware has just been bought by Salesforce.com, there is a compelling argument in using this to provide shopping basket & payment processing capability on your website, due to the ability to integrate the captured sales order and payment details in with the sales platform. Content Personalisation Both Adobe Experience Manager and Sitecore provide the ability to change the content and advertisements that are pitched to customers. Adobe Target also allows you to provide sets of elements on a webpage e.g. different banners, different color schemes etc. which will be presented to a customer and will get feedback from Adobe Analytics to work out which element variation generated the most conversions or revenue. Web Analytics In the web analytics space, most people start off with Google Analytics, but Adobe Analytics currently is the easier product with more features. Customer Identity & Access Management (CIAM) Here you need to be a little careful in identifying technologies that handle CIAM as opposed to more traditional IAM technologies that authenticate and authorise access to content to internal employees. Key differences include:- Customers, unlike employees, are in control of what information they wish to divulge, and need to be able to self-manage their contact details. Customers are often uniquely identified via social media providers (e.g. facebook, linkedin) nowadays, whereas internal employees wouldn't typically use this method. Customers need to provide consent for certain activities e.g. who is able to contact them, whereas consent for an employee is a condition of contract. Typically a company has many more customers than employees so CIAM has to deal with performance and have the ability to uniquely differentiate individuals This is an emerging market so isn't yet covered by a Gartner magic quadrant, although they have written some insight papers highlighting vendors working in this space. Most vendors are currently niche players e.g. Gigya, Janrain, Ping Identity, Stormpath, and UnboundID but IBM Cloud Identity Service and Salesforce Identity are solutions provided by major suppliers.

This scene has exploded over the last 10 years. Nowadays, the marketeers are capturing, amongst other things:- Where you're physically located - anybody with a smartphone can be tracked via triangulation of mobile network masts or wifi routers within cities. Your ip address can be reverse looked up to provide your actual address information. Which device you're using - tablet, PC, mobile phone etc. Which language you communicate in Which items you've liked on facebook Who your connections are, and what they like. How long a user has stayed on a particular web page and which part of the web page they spent longest on. What you've posted on social media like twitter Which advertisements you clicked on. What style of ads appeal to you. What keywords, what colours, what content. Where you go for your fitness runs - anybody whose got a fitbit or similar device often broadcasts this information to the world. What search engine you use. Where you shop, what you bought and what payment method you use. These kinds of data are now being accumulated on data management platforms, allowing the marketeers to provide fine-grained personalised content to you. This has benefits to the advertisers in that better targeted ads will result in more sales, but also better targeted ads will be less expensive, since keywords which attract a broad audience are priced much higher than those that a few people would respond to. For example, \"Hotel London\" currently costs £7 per click on Google Adwords.....It's been commented that it would be cheaper to offer to buy somebody a meal at McDonalds than it is to have them click on such an Ad at these kind of rates. With so much information to hand, it is becoming physically impossible for marketeers to actually be able to analyse the data manually within a short enough timescale, so increasingly data scientists are writing algorithms (code to fulfil a particular use case) to crunch the numbers and either recommend or sometimes deliver changes to ad campaigns in order to find the sweet spot that maximises clickthroughs. Data scientists are encouraged to compete with each other to discover insights in to data on sites like kaggle.com In future even more data will be collected from you. With the Internet of things, information about what you actually ate at home can be collected, for example, as your fridge will know what's been put in and what has been taken out. In recent years, Digital Marketing has progressed from Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), through Pay Per Click (PPC) to now looking at things such as Social Media Optimisation (SMO) and Conversion Rate Optimisation and will continue to fragment in to specialist areas providing deep insights in to consumer behaviour. The latest ideas are to avoid going for quick sales but to spend time raising brand awareness by leveraging influencers to promote the brand. Bloggers, Youtube content providers, top tweeters etc. are invited to free events by advertisers in anticipation that a certain percentage of them might promote the brand indirectly. Although, this may all seem very 'Big brother', there are many positive things from this. Ads which actually provide something that you want will be less annoying. Everybody has the ability to become an influencer in their area of interest, so this should make it easier to earn a living doing something that you actually enjoy. In future, you could be advised that you're running low on certain food supplies and a re-ordering facility could be set up. Your health could also be monitored, your genomes sequenced and appropriate medicines specific to your unique characteristics produced. These kinds of things will free up your time to do more interesting things, and improve your wellbeing. Is there much that you can do to stay 'under the radar'? If you wanted to, yes, you could refuse to allow tracking cookies or supply any of your details if they were to be passed on to a 3rd party. You could decide not to use a smartphone. You could not 'like' any product on facebook or communicate on social media. Effectively, you could live as people did quite happily in the 20th century. The problem is that the world in the 21st century will be geared up to you supplying this information. Much as you would find it hard to obtain credit without a credit history, without supplying information, you would be outside all of the networks which could be used to find work, hobbies, events, contacts, friends, health services etc. For all the negatives that a lack of privacy entails, there will be many more positives which should make your life easier.

There are a couple of frameworks which may assist you in developing your own technical strategy which are supplied by TOGAF(methodology framework) and Zachmann (documentation framework), but are deliberately generic in nature. The idea is that you take an enterprise architecture framework and adapt it for your particular organisations needs. The information below provides coverage of the 4 pillars of enterprise architecture which will need to be covered in order to investigate and implement an information management strategy. For a dotcom startup, enterprise architecture is probably low down in the list of things to do, as getting the product to market is of primary interest, without which the organisation would never scale to an extent where problems that enterprise architecture seeks to resolve, will actually emerge. At this embryonic stage, a single system is being created. As the organisation develops, more systems get added and business capabilities become more complex. With mergers and acquisitions, an organisation can eventually become so complex that business momentum grinds to a halt. For this reason, It is worth at least considering an enterprise architecture at an early stage so as to try to extend the initial momentum for as long as possible. Inception As with all projects, an information management strategy should start with a clear objective identified by the business. In a small business, this will likely come from the board of directors. In a larger organisation, it may appear as an item in a 5 year business strategy or an annual corporate scorecard. For example, the business might state that they need to increase revenue by better targeting customers in a particular market. From this 1 line objective, a technical strategy will then need to consider the best way of meeting this business objective taken in to consideration factors such as people, processes, available skills, existing capabilities and cost. Iterative Development When developing a technical strategy, bear in mind that you don't start off with detailed business requirements, so the strategy is developed in an iterative manner with adaptations to the strategy as business requirements emerge from affected business stakeholders which alter the direction of travel and/or the overarching business strategy changes. Advantages of developing a technical strategy Without a technical strategy in place, solutions and individual delivery projects will make their own decisions leading to an organisation which becomes increasingly more complex to manage and information which is disjointed and difficult, costly and sometimes impossible to integrate. The 4 pillars of Enterprise Architecture There are 4 main pillars (Note: TOGAF merges information and application architecture in to information systems architecture) to consider when developing your technical strategy. For each pillar, an \"As is\" and \"To be\" view needs to be presented. Each section to tie back to the business objectives, providing viewpoints from the perspective of different business areas, where appropriate. Business Architecture This pillar is slightly unusual in that the expectation might be that a business development function would be responsible for this area. IT often tends to get involved in developing a business architecture due to the fact that IT is cross-functional in nature, and due to the fact that changes to IT systems can drive changes in business processes or require the addition of new business processes. Business architecture feeds in to an information management strategy by identifying the key business capabilities and processes which are reliant on information. One of the first thing to consider are the business capabilities that are already in the business, and the capabilities that you will need to operate the solution post go-live. For your particular industry there may be generic business capability models which can assist you in developing your business capability/service landscape. For example, a business capability landscape has been created for the banking industry by BIAN The idea is to remove the complexity that an organisational structure imposes on the enterprise and identify the more generic business capabilities that they actually carry out. For a large project, it is also worthwhile creating a value chain. This can demonstrate either the value added to the business at each stage from when a consumer is first marketed to, through to supporting the customer and/or a technical value chain could be created showing how data is improved from when it is acquired to when it is consumed. The diagram shows an example technical value chain for a business intelligence solution.Once you've captured your business capability model and value chain, you can create a target operating model (TOM) which should also cover new systems which need to be in place to support the new initiative, the location of the new business capabilities and any effect on customers and external organisations that changes in people, process and systems will necessitate. Information Architecture This pillar deals with enterprise wide data standards and policies around how you handle information, reference data models and data governance. There is a general push in the big data community to avoid upfront production of enterprise reference data models and produce self-describing metadata using formats such as XML and JSON which can be more flexibly modified. The advantage of this approach is that in the situation where you're developing a website, you can quickly amend the way in which persist data to a data store without incurring the upfront cost that data modelling can impose in slowing down your website development. For a \"speed to market\" initiative, this makes a lot of sense, but ultimately there's a price to pay in more complex data integration when it comes to producing standardised reporting covering information supplied from separate applications. You may be able to get assistance in developing a reference data model for your enterprise by using one that has been developed for your industry. For example, in banking, the ISO20022 business model provides a reference data model which is centred on payment processing but provides entities and relationships which also cover to an extent, cash management, deposit accounting, credits and trade finance. You can take the industry reference data model and adapt it to your enterprise's needs adding and subtracting entities, attributes and relationships to correctly identify your business data structure. In the absence of an industry reference data model, other approaches are to look for an industry ontology or taxonomies, which in layman's terms is the grouping and classification of attributes, with ontologies covering a set of taxonomies and being more rigorous in their description of the relationships between objects. If you cannot find these, then you could look for industry dictionaries, and finally try to produce your own reference data model by examining existing databases within your organisation and related published data models available on the internet. Data governance refers to the practice of gaining approval from the business for names and definitions of business attributes and measures which are used by consuming systems, tracking data quality issues and putting in place data authorisation procedures to ensure that data is appropriately secured. Other aspects which need to be examined include data quality, master data management, data integration (application and database), data lifecycle management, data migration approaches, business intelligence (reporting & dashboards and analytics). Application Architecture This pillar covers the choice of development frameworks and architectural patterns that you intend to use when implementing your technical strategy. Some advantages of doing this work at the enterprise level is that application designs can be created more quickly and development projects will use a consistent approach reducing implementation times. There are differing design patterns:- For a traditional data warehouse/business intelligence solution. Solutions that need to process large volumes of data (aka big data) e.g. processing of web logs Solutions that need to analyse data in near real time in order to extract information e.g. detecting that a user has shown interest in a product on the web and sending an email or promoting adverts featuring that product on other web pages. Technology Architecture This final pillar covers the choice of hardware and software that is desirable to meet a particular technical function. By making these decisions at the enterprise level, cost benefits can be achieved by negotiating better deals with specific vendors, acquiring expertise in a restricted set of tools and by reducing system integration issues. Other aspects include security and location of the infrastructure e.g. on-premise, in the cloud or a hybrid model. Architectural Roadmap A logical order of steps should be created for the expected duration of the initiative with transition steps that take you to each stage along the journey highlighted. Note: The Architectural roadmap does not necessarily translate in to a delivery roadmap. For example, building an integrated operational data store may involve multiple delivery projects populating and integrating data from different data sources, but be a single item in the architectural roadmap.","tags":"Enterprise Architecture","url":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/info-strategy-dev.html","loc":"https://deytalytics.github.io/deyblog/info-strategy-dev.html"}]};
