              <ul><li>Climate Solutions is a London based organisation that's aiming to highlight solutions to resolve the climate emergency.</li>
                  <li>However, you feel about climate change, solutions that replace fossil fuels with renewable energy will lead to a cleaner planet for everybody, and high profile world governmental organisations such as the UK, the EU & China have committed to go zero carbon by 2050 or 2060</li>
                  <li>The aim of this website is to highlight cost effective solutions, where they exist today or are under development.</li>
                  <li>In some situations, solutions won't be cost effective but will be of low cost.</li>
                  <li>The aim is not to persuade you that you need to radically alter your lifestyle or pay thousands of pounds, it's to identify incremental improvements that you could make that will improve your life.</li>
                  <li> The site is most definitely not here to promote political viewpoints, and these will be removed from any blog comments. </li>
