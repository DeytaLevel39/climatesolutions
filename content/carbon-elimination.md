Summary: Discusses how much progress has been made in the UK in reducing the use of fossil fuels

## UK Media Focus
When climate change is promoted in the UK, most people think of:-

Or even

These are climate activists who've been reasonably successful at highlighting the problems that the burning of fossil fuels provide, but in terms of solutions, 
very little is provided or there is a call for a radical change in people's lifestyles - stop eating meat, stop going on holiday, stop buying fast fashion etc. 

What there is much less of a focus on is that UK companies across the board have made huge reductions in their use of fossil fuels and this trend is likely to continue.

## Coal - the fossilised fossil fuel 
If you think about it, the UK kicked off the industrial revolution using a fossil fuel that is 
pretty much not used anywhere in the UK now - coal. 
The UK government announced in February 2020, that [Coal will completely disappear as an energy supply by 1 October 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/end-of-coal-power-to-be-brought-forward-in-drive-towards-net-zero#:~:text=The%20deadline%20for%20the%20phase,a%20speech%20to%20launch%20COP26%20.&text=Last%20year%20more%20than%20half,came%20from%20low%2Dcarbon%20sources.) at latest.
Up until the 1950s, coal was the main form of domestic heating, powered trains as well as industry, so it's amazing 
how quickly it's disappeared, and does anybody mourn it's loss?
The evidence of coal is gradually disappearing even from the landscape. Pits have been closed down, slag heaps grassed over and the effects of smoke on buildings sandblasted away. 
London's reputation as a city of permanent smog is confined to the history books.

## Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas have more than displaced Coal in terms of energy supply, but Oil has rapidly been displaced by renewable energy in terms of electricity supply, already. It's increased use is mainly due to Transport

The energy ratio (consumption divided by GDP) has fallen to less than 50% of 1990 levels. The ratio of carbon has fallen by 2/3. This has been achieved whilst still growing our economy

##Can we burn fossil fuels indefinitely?

The answer is no, fossil fuels are created over millions of years from initial decomposition of animal & vegestation and pressure. 
It's not possible to reproduce this, and identifying and extracting new sources of fossil fuels gets more difficult over time. 
So even if we set aside all of the environmental arguments for ending fossil fuels, the reality is that we are likely to run out of them within the next 100 years
