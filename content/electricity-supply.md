Summary: Covers challenges & solutions dealing with electricity supply's move away from fossil fuels

This has probably been the biggest success story so far in terms of CO2 emission reductions.
The reduction in use of fossil fuels in this area has primarily been achieved by investing in:-

* Offshore & Onshore Wind Turbines
* Solar Farms
* Hydroelectricity
* Nuclear
* Biomass
* Geothermal

Every country has a different challenge and different solutions here. 

The challenge varies dependent on a country's access to renewable resources and it's population i.e. it's much easier for a country like New Zealand to move to zero carbon than it would be for the Netherlands 

In north western Europe, Onshore Wind has proved to be the most cost-effective solution. In southern Europe, Solar farms are the better option. 
In Iceland, Geothermal supplies most of their energy. 

The use of renewables for electrical supply continues to increase as a percentage, but the pie is getting bigger. We need renewables to start to encroach on fossil fuel energy demand, and not just prevent further increase as is the current situation.
