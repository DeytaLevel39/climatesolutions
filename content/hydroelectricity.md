## Industry & Government Solution 

Hydroelectricity is produced by installing turbines within dams which use the flow of water to turn the turbines and, therefore, generate electricity.
Hydro is, therefore, a primary source of renewable energy in some countries. 
There is another aspect of hydro that can further boost it's use as a renewable. Currently, due to problems in stablility of the national grid, when the sun shines too brightly or the wind blows too fiercely, the energy is wasted. 
This surplus energy can be used to pump water back in to the dams in order that the energy can be used later rather.
