<h2>Background</h2>
The impact of the burning of fossil fuels is very well known by now, and the EU, the UK & China have committed to taking steps to reduce their CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050/60.

In order to meet those goals, new technical solutions will be required.

Surprisingly, the world's use of fossil fuels really took off fairly recently - after the Second World War:-

The good news is that the whole world has become much more energy efficient in last 25 to 30 years:-

The questions now are:- 
* [Will fossil fuels ever end?](carbon-elimination.html) 
* Can more be achieved? 
* What's available now?
* what will be available in the future and by when.

Rather than focusing on negative stories, this website intends to highlight solutions to get us to a zero carbon future.

In order to achieve zero carbon emissions, the following areas will need to be addressed
