The impact of the burning of fossil fuels is very well known by now, and the EU, the UK & China have committed to taking steps to reduce their CO2 emissions by net zero.
The question is how will this be achieved, what's available now and what will be available in the future and by when.

In order to achieve zero carbon emissions, the following areas will need to be addressed

## Electrical Power Supply
This has probably been the biggest success story so far in terms of CO2 emission reductions.
The reduction in use of fossil fuels in this area has primarily been achieved by investing in:-
* Offshore & Onshore Wind Turbines
* Solar Farms
* Hydroelectricity
* Nuclear
* Biomass
* Geothermal

Every country has a different challenge and different solutions here. 

The challenge varies dependent on a country's access to renewable resources and it's population i.e. it's much easier for a country like New Zealand to move to zero carbon than it would be for the Netherlands 

In north western Europe, Onshore Wind has proved to be the most cost-effective solution. In southern Europe, Solar farms are the better option. 
In Iceland, Geothermal supplies most of their energy.
