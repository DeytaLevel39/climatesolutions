##Background 
The impact of the burning of fossil fuels is very well known by now, and the EU, the UK & China have committed to taking steps to reduce their CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050/60.

In order to meet those goals, new technical solutions will be required. 

Surprisingly, the world's use of fossil fuels really took off fairly recently - after the Second World War:-

The good news is that the whole world has become much more energy efficient in last 25 to 30 years:-

The question is how can more be achieved, what's available now and what will be available in the future and by when.

Rather than focusing on negative stories, this website intends to highlight solutions to get us to a zero carbon future.

In order to achieve zero carbon emissions, the following areas will need to be addressed
