The challenges in the Agricultural sector include:-

* Domesticated Animals that are produced for meat require large areas of lands for crops to feed them.
* Animals such as [cows emit large amounts of methane](https://ideas.ted.com/methane-isnt-just-cow-farts-its-also-cow-burps-and-other-weird-facts-you-didnt-know-about-this-potent-greenhouse-gas/), which is another greenhouse gas
* Crops to feed billions of people are now reliant on [fertilisers which are in turn heavily dependent on natural gas](https://www.fertilizerseurope.com/fertilizers-in-europe/how-fertilizers-are-made/). 
* One of the primary fertilisers, Ammonium Nitrate, as well as using vast quantities of natural gas is an explosive which has been used in terrorist incidents 

## Individual solutions:-
* Cut down as much as possible on meat, and specifically on meat

## Industry solutions 
* Encourage [use of Urea over Ammonium Nitrate for row crop production](http://aes.missouri.edu/pfcs/research/prop105a.pdf)
* Encourage [use of Ammonium Sulphate for pasture crop production](http://aes.missouri.edu/pfcs/research/prop105a.pdf)

## Government solutions
* Educate farmers that the use of Urea & Ammonium Sulphate can produce higher yields than Ammonium Nitrate.
* Educate farmers that changing their animal feed can reduce methane production
