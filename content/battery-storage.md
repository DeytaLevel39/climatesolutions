Summary: Covers technology to store energy in batteries

This is the optimal solution. If better batteries can be invented, the reliance on fossil fuels disappears as solar & wind can be stored for use when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.
The good news here is that Lithium ion battery storage continues to decrease in price. There will be a need for substantial improvements in battery tech, however.
