Simple solutions that anybody can do include:-

## Food & Drink
* Reduce the amount of meat that you eat, especially Beef - Cows produce a lot of methane from their breath as well as their behinds
* If you're going out on a trip, remember to fill an existing bottle with water or juice, rather than buying a plastic water bottle

## Transport
* Consider going to foreign holidays by train rather than aeroplane. Trains are increasingly electrified so can be powered by renewable energy, whereas aeroplanes still need to wait for fossil fuel alternatives such as green hydrogen.
* Walk, Ride a bicycle or rent an eScooter for local to medium distance journeys
* Rent a car on a daily basis if you're an infrequent driver - unused cars congest roads. Congested roads increase CO2 & air pollution
* Don't use the car for short trips
* Make more frequent trips to local supermarkets or pick up food on way back from work, rather than do a special trip for a weekly shop

## Shopping
* Reduce your use of plastic bags, which are made from oil

## Insulation & Domestic Heating
* Add draught excluders around all ground floor doors - this is the most cost effective way to reduce heat loss
* Add radiator insulator foil behind radiators located on external walls - most heat is lost from the rear of a radiator on an external wall. The foil will ensure that more heated air is convected up rather than conducted through the wall
* Wear vests & jumpers in Winter - it's much better to heat you, than heat your living space.
* Take a bath or shower - this will heat your core and keep you warm for a couple of hours after you've come out
* Go outside for exercise - the feeling of warmth is relative, so when you come in from outside, the house will feel much warmer
* Get a programmable thermostat - these allow you to adjust temperature for different hours of the day so allows more control than standard thermostats
* Turn down radiator valves in upper floor rooms - Heat rises, so if it's pleasant downstairs, it will be warm upstairs
