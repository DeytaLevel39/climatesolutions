There are a couple of potential solutions for hot water storage:-

* Hot water heaters - can either be powered by solar panels during the day or from low cost overnight electricity tariffs
* Solar thermal plus hot water tank - Uses solar energy to heat the water directly, and then uses a tank to hold any excess heat.

Of the 2, I think the first solution is the better one due to the flexibility of being able to use low cost tariffs during times when solar power isn't available.
